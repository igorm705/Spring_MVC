The site uses a database to save the chat messages. Where the database will be ex4.
The structure of the tables of your choice is for you to create them automatically by JPA entities.
<br>
A user registers his name, clicks a button and enters chat with other users.
<br>
Total sign-in page:
• Form contains input type text for user name input.
• A button to enter the chat room
<br>
An error message should be printed if the name is empty (or contains spaces only).
That is to say, trim () must be performed on each user's input. You do not need to
double-check names (users with the same name can appear).
When a user logs in only the last 3 messages will appear.
Chatroom page includes:
<br>
<ul>Header text: Welcome < username > where username>> contains the user name
    • Form with text input and a button to send a message to chat
    • A button to exit the chat
    • Chat: content of all messages sent (sender's name and message to each)
    </ul>
<br>
    This page is automatically updated every 30 seconds without loading the page again.
    You must use Ajax and implement a controller that returns the chat content in the
    JSON format. <br>In addition, the page will automatically switch to the login page, if
    the user is no longer logged in. This can happen when the user opens two pages and
    logs off.
